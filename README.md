# E06b-Tiles
For this assignment, I downloaded the Tiled Map Editor from https://www.mapeditor.org. When I finished downloading the file, I opened a file called 'tiled.' After opening the file, I made a map. When the game is played, an alien will move around to collect the coins. When I finished making the map, I ran main1.py to check if it works or not. Luckily, it worked. Then, I edited LICENSE and README.md.
